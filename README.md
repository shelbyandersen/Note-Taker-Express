## Description

This project utilizes Express.js to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The note data is retrieved from a JSON file. This application is practical for a user who would like to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks to complete.

This application allows users to create and save notes. A user can also view previously saved notes. Finally, a user can delete notes if they choose.

# Installation

The code for the Note Taker Express Application can be found on github using the following link:

- https://github.com/shelbyandersen/Note-Taker-Express

# Usage

The Note Taker Express Application uses express.js, node.js, and fs. POSTMAN was utilized for testing the backend of the application.

The GET `/notes` path returns the `notes.html` file

The GET `*` path returns the `index.html` file

This application utilizes the `fs` module to retrieve notes from `db.json`

There are three API routes utilized in this application:

- GET (used to read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON)
- POST (used to receive a new note on the request body and add it to the `db.json` file and return the new note to the client)
- DELETE ( `/api/notes:id` receives a new parameter containing the id of a note to delete. The note is deleted based on the id)

The final application is deployed on Heroku.
